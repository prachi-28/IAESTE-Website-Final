        <p class="desc">In the light of competition, the scavenger hunt brings together unfamiliar faces for fun,
          indigenous tasks each of which teaches you something glorious about Indian culture
          and history. India is more than a just a country or a federation of states, its a collection
          of myriad experiences. For a traveller, memories of India would be difficult to share
          verbally as India bombards you with taste, smells, visions, and sounds from the moment
          you arrive. These experiences vary significantly across the country. An intern may not
          be able to visit many places, but we as the local committee try to recreate some of
          these experiences for the interns right here in Manipal, which in itself is a microcosm of
          India.
          Themed on four major cities - Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai, you have to
          complete tasks at each location that represents one of these cities to receive the clue
          for the next one. Interns enjoyed paani puri and Bollywood dance from Mumbai, a
          variety of parathas and a monument themed puzzle from Delhi, street cricket from
          Kolkata and fun lungi relay race themed on Chennai. The beauty of the whole event is
          that the teams function on the same principle as our country does - ‘unity in diversity’.</p>
