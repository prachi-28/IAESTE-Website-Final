            <p class="quote">I had been selected for an internship at Karel Electronics in Ankara, Turkey via IAESTE.
              This internship
              experience has been one of the best ever, all thanks to IAESTE and its associates. Starting from the
              Incoming Team at IAESTE LC Manipal, to me bidding adieu to Turkey, the process was smooth, well planned
              and complete. The overall experience I had at Turkey was a memorable one indeed, and will always be
              cherished. I would like to thank IAESTE for this internship opportunity. It has helped me enhace not only
              my skills and helped develop me as an individual, develop more friendships and provide me with a memorable
              experience for life. I strongly recommend this internship and thank IAESTE for the opportunity. </p>

            <p class="quote">I am a fourth year student of Computer Science and Engineering in Manipal Institute of
              Technology and I
              interned at Glasgow Caledonian University, Scotland during the summer of 2017. IAESTE India LC Manipal
              guided me in preparing my nomination and forwarded all the acceptance documents I would need for the visa
              application. The Local Committee members of IAESTE Glasgow helped in finding an accommodation for me and
              made sure that I had a comfortable stay there. They also organized trips and events to make the experience
              even more memorable.</p>

            <p class="quote">I completed an internship at the Kasetsart University, Sakon Nakhon, Thailand from the
              duration of 24 th
              May,2018 to 24 th July,2018. The internship involved us building an Artificial Farming cabinet. Each day
              brought different circumstances and I had the opportunity to make decisions on my ownand learn from both
              my successes and failures. The internship was a worthwhile experience and I feel that it has prepared me
              well for my professional career. The hospitality from the teachers and the students alike at the
              university was very warm and cordial. We were engaged in a lot of team building exercises such at
              different sporting activities, literary meets and dinner parties. I also had the opportunity of going on a
              trip across Thailand along with fellow international interns. Overall my 2 month long trip to Thailand was
              a very rich experience both educationally and culturally. Finally I would like to thank IAESTE for giving
              me this opportunity to gain an lifelong cherishable experience.</p>
