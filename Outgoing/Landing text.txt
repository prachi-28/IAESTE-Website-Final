The Outgoing department of IAESTE LC Manipal is an integral part of our mission- to facilitate global technical and cultural exchange, through internships. 
We provide assistance at every step between you, and your dream internship - from processing your documents, and providing visa assistance, to arranging accommodation at your desired destination. 
The majority of IAESTE internships last for 2â€“3 months and frequently take place in summer. The internships are also paid, with salaries usually adjusted in line with country-specific student living costs. The IAESTE committee abroad will make suitable living arrangements for you and will be on hand to provide you with guidance at all times. Feel free to also contact IAESTE LC Manipal, should you face any issues- we will be happy to help!
